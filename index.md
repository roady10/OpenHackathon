# About Problem Statements

## VISION

> To innovate and replace existing non-efficient closed systems with more transparent, efficient system using blockchain.

## NOTES
> Each problem statement is designed to be a strong, practical blockchain based solution and hence every solution for the problem statement stated below must be built around / using XDC blockchain.
> Apart from mandatory inclusion of blockchain, participants are given complete freedom for choosing technology, programming languages etc. in the development of the application.
> Problem statements are meant to be generic in order to give participants flexibility to work around.


## Use Cases

### Change Proof of Work (PoW) Consensus in blockchain

Too much energy consumption make PoW consensus non practical and not suitable for real world system.
We need to find out other innovative consensus where transaction and network remains de-centralised but without much energy consumption. Many experts trying Proof of stake like DPoS. Restriction numbers of node make its more centralized while large number of nodes makes the system very slow.
We need to find out innovative solution to replace PoW Consensus with other Consensus which gives more efficiency, speed and less energy consumption.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
